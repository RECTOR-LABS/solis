## Build Ideas

### 1. Memecoin Safety Score API
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 2-4 weeks
Build a real-time API that analyzes memecoin contracts for rug-pull indicators, liquidity lock status, and holder distribution patterns. Integrate with fdv.lol data to provide risk scores that trading bots and launchpads can query before execution.
**Why now:** Memecoin trading volume is at all-time highs with 335 commits to fdv.lol (15.6 z-score), but there's no standardized safety layer. Traders are losing millions to rugs weekly—a safety API would be immediately adopted by launchpads and bots as a risk filter.
**Tech stack:** Rust, Solana Web3.js, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Anchor IDL parsing
**Reference projects:** fdv.lol, PumpSwap, solana-sniper-copy-mev-trading-bot
### 2. Memecoin Launch Analytics Dashboard

**Tech stack:** Next.js, Anchor, Solana Web3.js, MagicBlock SDK, PostgreSQL
**Reference projects:** magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-Core, cornel-pe/casino-hub
### 12. Memecoin Community Analytics & Sentiment Engine
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 3-4 weeks
Build a tool that aggregates Discord/Twitter sentiment for memecoins, tracks community growth velocity, and predicts pump/dump cycles using NLP. Provide API access for traders and launchpads.
**Why now:** Memecoin success is driven by community sentiment, but there's no standardized sentiment tracking. As memecoin volume explodes, sentiment analysis would be immediately valuable for traders trying to identify the next 100x.
**Tech stack:** Python, Tweepy/Discord.py, Hugging Face Transformers, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
**Reference projects:** fdv.lol, PumpSwap
### 13. AI Agent Yield Farming Optimizer
**Difficulty:** advanced | **Timeframe:** 5-7 weeks
Build an autonomous AI agent that monitors yield farming opportunities across Kamino, Orca, and Raydium, calculates optimal liquidity provision strategies, and automatically migrates capital to highest-yield positions. Use Claude for strategy reasoning.
