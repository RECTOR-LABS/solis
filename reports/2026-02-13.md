## Build Ideas

### 1. Helium Oracle Price Feed Aggregator Dashboard
**Difficulty:** beginner | **Timeframe:** 2-3 days
Build a real-time dashboard that aggregates Helium oracle price feeds across multiple data providers and displays confidence intervals, update latency, and historical accuracy metrics. This addresses the need for oracle transparency as Helium expands its infrastructure to support more ecosystem integrations.
**Why now:** Helium's 14 commits (anomaly period) signal infrastructure hardening. As oracle adoption accelerates, builders need transparency tools to verify feed quality and detect anomalies before integrating into production systems.

### 10. Marginfi Liquidation Prediction & Early Warning System
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 2-3 weeks
Build a real-time monitoring system that predicts liquidations on Marginfi by tracking collateral ratios, price movements, and borrower health factors. Provide alerts to liquidators and borrowers before liquidation events occur.
**Why now:** Marginfi shows -7 commits but maintains 1,000 tx baseline, indicating operational stability. As TVL declines $1.75B, liquidation risk increases, making early warning systems critical for protocol health and borrower protection.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, Marginfi SDK, Solana Web3.js, Next.js, WebSocket API, Discord/Telegram bot
**Reference projects:** Marginfi, Solend, Drift Protocol, Aave liquidation monitor
### 11. Stablecoin Yield Aggregator with DeFi Reentry Signals

Create a memecoin launchpad that enforces best practices: gradual token unlock schedules, liquidity locks, and holder concentration limits. Target retail creators who want legitimacy without sacrificing meme appeal.
**Why now:** Meme tokens show extreme volatility with peak speculation indicators. As the cycle decelerates, creators will seek platforms offering legitimacy and risk controls to attract institutional/serious retail capital.
**Tech stack:** Anchor/Rust, TypeScript, Next.js, Metaplex Token Metadata, Raydium SDK
**Reference projects:** PumpSwap, Magic Eden Launchpad, Raydium Fusion
### 14. Drift Protocol Synthetic Asset Composer
