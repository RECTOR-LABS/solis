## Build Ideas

### 1. LLM-Powered Intent-Based Trading Agent for Solana
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 2-4 weeks
Build an autonomous trading agent that accepts natural language trading intents (e.g., 'swap 10 SOL for USDC on the best route') and executes them via Solana RPC + Jupiter aggregator. The agent uses Claude/GPT-4 to parse intent, validate risk parameters, and execute transactions with Jito MEV protection.
**Why now:** OpenAI-powered trading agents are launching now (x402 repos show active development), but most are either closed-source or lack robust MEV protection. Solana's Jito integration + Jupiter's market dominance create a unique window to build the first production-grade intent-based agent with MEV awareness.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, Anthropic Claude API / OpenAI GPT-4, Solana Web3.js, Jupiter Swap SDK, Jito Bundles API, Helius RPC
**Reference projects:** qntx/x402-openai-typescript, qntx/kobe, Drakkar-Software/OctoBot
### 2. MEV Transparency Dashboard for Validators
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 3-4 weeks
Create a real-time dashboard that visualizes MEV extraction across Jito, Firedancer, and Anza validator clients. Display per-validator MEV revenue, bundle acceptance rates, and latency metrics to help validators optimize their infrastructure choices and understand profitability trade-offs.
**Why now:** Jito infrastructure is maturing (+7 commits, highest in dataset) and validator client diversity is increasing (Anza, Firedancer competing). Validators lack transparent tools to compare MEV economics across clients—this gap exists NOW as the ecosystem fragments.
**Tech stack:** Rust, Solana RPC API, Jito Searcher API, PostgreSQL, Next.js, TailwindCSS, WebSocket
**Reference projects:** jito-foundation/jito-solana, anza-xyz/agave, firedancer-io/firedancer
### 3. Pump.fun Copy-Trading Risk Analyzer
**Difficulty:** beginner | **Timeframe:** 2-3 days
Build a browser extension that analyzes pump.fun tokens before copy-trading execution. It scores token risk (contract analysis, holder concentration, liquidity depth) and simulates slippage/MEV impact using Jito simulation APIs. Integrates with existing sniper bots to inject risk guardrails.
**Why now:** Pump.fun volume is $707M (+65% delta) but sniper bot proliferation has created a race-to-the-bottom in risk management. Users are losing money to MEV and rug pulls—a risk layer on top of existing bots fills an immediate need as tooling matures.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, React, Solana Web3.js, Jito Simulation API, Magic Eden API, Chrome Extension API
**Reference projects:** hanshaze/solana-sniper-copy-mev-trading-bot, lorine93s/pumpfun-raydium-sniper-rust-bot, chainstacklabs/pumpfun-bonkfun-bot
### 4. BisonFi/HumidiFi Liquidity Aggregator SDK
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 2-3 weeks
Create an SDK that routes swaps across BisonFi, HumidiFi, Raydium, and Orca to find optimal execution prices. Include concentrated liquidity awareness (CLMM pools) and MEV-protected routing via Jito. Package as npm module for easy integration into trading UIs.
**Why now:** BisonFi ($521M) and HumidiFi ($254M) are capturing significant volume but lack unified routing infrastructure. Jupiter dominates, but these emerging DEXs are fragmenting liquidity—an aggregator SDK NOW captures market share before one DEX consolidates.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, Solana Web3.js, BisonFi API, HumidiFi API, Raydium SDK, Orca SDK, Jito Bundles
**Reference projects:** mayan-finance/swap-sdk, Jupiter aggregator
### 5. Multi-Chain Wallet Solana Optimization Layer
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 2-4 weeks
Build a Solana-specific optimization module for multi-chain wallets (OneKey, Unstoppable, Oisy) that auto-selects RPC endpoints, batches transactions, and applies Jito MEV protection. Expose as a pluggable SDK that wallet teams can integrate to improve Solana UX.
**Why now:** Multi-chain wallets treat Solana as a commodity chain with no optimization. Solana's unique MEV/RPC landscape (Jito, Helius, Triton) is underutilized in wallet UX. NOW is the moment to standardize Solana optimization as wallets compete on UX.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, Solana Web3.js, Helius RPC, Jito Bundles API, React Native (for mobile wallets)
**Reference projects:** OneKeyHQ/app-monorepo, coral-xyz/backpack, horizontalsystems/unstoppable-wallet-android
### 6. Sniper Bot Performance Benchmarking Platform
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 3-4 weeks
Create a SaaS platform that benchmarks sniper bot performance across Raydium/pump.fun launches. Track win rate, average profit/loss, execution latency, and MEV costs. Provide leaderboards and bot comparison tools to help traders choose the best tool for their strategy.
**Why now:** Sniper bot ecosystem is mature but fragmented—no transparency on which bots actually perform. Traders are making blind choices. A benchmarking platform NOW creates a market signal that rewards quality tooling and punishes scams.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, Solana Web3.js, PostgreSQL, Next.js, Jito Searcher API, Helius RPC
**Reference projects:** hanshaze/solana-sniper-copy-mev-trading-bot, lorine93s/pumpfun-raydium-sniper-rust-bot, katlogic/solana-arbitrage-bot
### 7. Solana Smart Contract Security Audit Automation
**Difficulty:** advanced | **Timeframe:** 6-8 weeks
Build an automated security scanner that integrates Certora formal verification with Solana-specific vulnerability patterns (e.g., signer checks, rent exemption, instruction ordering). Expose as GitHub Actions workflow + CLI tool for developers to run pre-deployment audits.
**Why now:** Security tooling is accelerating (+3 stars on Rektoff repo) as TVL grows and hacks increase. Certora supports Solana but lacks Solana-specific rules. Developers need automated pre-deployment checks NOW before mainnet launches.
**Tech stack:** Rust, Solana SDK, Certora Prover, GitHub Actions, TypeScript (CLI), LLVM
**Reference projects:** Rektoff/Security-Roadmap-for-Solana-applications, Certora/CertoraProver, solana-developers/developer-bootcamp-2024
### 8. Cross-Chain Arbitrage Bot for Solana Hub
**Difficulty:** advanced | **Timeframe:** 4-6 weeks
Build a bot that detects price discrepancies between Solana (Raydium/Orca) and EVM chains (Uniswap/Curve), executes cross-chain swaps via Mayan Finance SDK, and captures arbitrage spreads. Include MEV protection via Jito for Solana leg.
**Why now:** Cross-chain swap infrastructure (Mayan) is stable but arbitrage tooling is nascent. Solana is positioned as a hub in multi-chain flows NOW—first-mover advantage in cross-chain arb automation is significant.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, Solana Web3.js, Ethers.js, Mayan Finance SDK, Jito Bundles API, Helius RPC, Alchemy RPC
**Reference projects:** mayan-finance/swap-sdk, Jupiter aggregator, Raydium
### 9. Solana Gaming Crash Game with Provably Fair Mechanics
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 3-4 weeks
Build a crash game (similar to Stake.com) with on-chain provably fair randomness using Solana's VRF. Include multiplayer lobbies, leaderboards, and token rewards. Use Anchor framework for smart contracts and Next.js for frontend.
**Why now:** Gaming infrastructure on Solana is stable but lacks polished, production-grade titles. Crash games are simple to build but high-margin—NOW is the moment to capture gaming users before competitors consolidate the vertical.
**Tech stack:** Rust (Anchor), TypeScript, Next.js, Solana Web3.js, Switchboard VRF, PostgreSQL, WebSocket
**Reference projects:** lorine93s/Blockchain-Casino-game, rustyneuron01/Web3-Casino-Crash-Game-Gamefi, Tensor, Magic Eden
### 10. Concentrated Liquidity Position Manager Dashboard
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 2-3 weeks
Create a dashboard for managing concentrated liquidity positions across Orca Whirlpools, Raydium CLMM, and Meteora DLMM. Features include rebalancing recommendations, impermanent loss tracking, fee optimization, and one-click position adjustments. Integrate with wallet for seamless execution.
**Why now:** Concentrated liquidity protocols are processing 1000 txs each and ORCA is +35.6% 14d—market validation is clear. But position management is fragmented across UIs. A unified dashboard NOW captures LPs frustrated with multi-protocol complexity.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, Next.js, Solana Web3.js, Orca SDK, Raydium SDK, Meteora SDK, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL
**Reference projects:** orca-so/whirlpools, MeteoraAg/dlmm-sdk, raydium-io/raydium-clmm
### 11. Solana Developer Bootcamp Capstone Project Marketplace
**Difficulty:** beginner | **Timeframe:** 2-3 weeks
Build a marketplace where bootcamp graduates can showcase capstone projects, connect with mentors, and find funding/job opportunities. Include project filtering by skill level, tech stack, and funding stage. Integrate with Superteam DAO for grant distribution.
**Why now:** Developer bootcamp infrastructure is expanding (2024 bootcamp active) but lacks a post-graduation funnel. Graduates need visibility and funding—a marketplace NOW captures the cohort effect as bootcamp alumni grow.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, Next.js, Supabase, TailwindCSS, Solana Web3.js, GitHub API
**Reference projects:** solana-developers/developer-bootcamp-2024, SuperteamDAO/earn, solana-playground/solana-playground
### 12. Intent-Based MEV Protection Middleware
**Difficulty:** advanced | **Timeframe:** 4-6 weeks
Build a middleware layer that intercepts trading intents from LLM agents and automatically wraps them in Jito bundles with MEV protection. Provide configurable slippage/MEV cost thresholds and fallback strategies if protection fails. Expose as a service for AI trading platforms.
**Why now:** AI trading agents are launching without MEV protection—this is a critical gap. Jito infrastructure is mature enough to build middleware NOW. First-mover advantage in agent-native MEV protection is significant.
**Tech stack:** Rust, Solana Web3.js, Jito Bundles API, Helius RPC, gRPC, TypeScript (API layer)
**Reference projects:** qntx/x402-openai-python, jito-foundation/jito-solana
### 13. Validator Economics Simulator & Optimization Tool
**Difficulty:** advanced | **Timeframe:** 6-8 weeks
Build a simulator that models validator profitability under different client choices (Jito, Firedancer, Anza), MEV strategies, and hardware configurations. Provide recommendations on optimal setup for target revenue. Include historical performance data and scenario analysis.
**Why now:** Validator client diversity is increasing (Anza, Firedancer competing with Jito) but validators lack tools to compare economics. MEV infrastructure is maturing—NOW is the moment to build decision-support tools before validator consolidation.
**Tech stack:** Rust, Solana RPC API, Jito Searcher API, PostgreSQL, Python (modeling), Next.js (dashboard)
**Reference projects:** jito-foundation/jito-solana, anza-xyz/agave, firedancer-io/firedancer
### 14. Pump.fun Token Fundamentals API
**Difficulty:** beginner | **Timeframe:** 1-2 weeks
Create a REST API that provides real-time fundamentals for pump.fun tokens: holder distribution, contract analysis, liquidity depth, trading volume, and social sentiment. Expose as a service for sniper bots and trading UIs to make data-driven decisions.
**Why now:** Pump.fun volume is $707M but sniper bots lack standardized data APIs. Each bot reimplements analysis—a centralized API NOW reduces duplication and improves data quality across the ecosystem.
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Solana Web3.js, Magic Eden API
**Reference projects:** hanshaze/solana-sniper-copy-mev-trading-bot, lorine93s/pumpfun-raydium-sniper-rust-bot
