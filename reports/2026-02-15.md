## Build Ideas

### 1. Jito MEV Dashboard & Validator Performance Analytics
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 2-4 weeks
Build a real-time dashboard that aggregates MEV extraction metrics, validator tip router performance, and stake pool yields across Jito infrastructure. This fills the gap between raw MEV data and actionable validator optimization insights, enabling operators to benchmark performance and optimize configurations.
**Why now:** Jito's 5 recent commits signal active infrastructure hardening. Validators adopting Jito need visibility into optimization ROI—no standardized analytics exist yet. This captures the transition from experimental MEV to operational validator management.
**Tech stack:** Rust (Solana client), Next.js/React, PostgreSQL, Jito SDK, WebSocket for real-time updates
**Reference projects:** Jito Tip Router, Jito Stake Pool, Solana Beach (block explorer)
### 2. Pump.fun Liquidity Automation & Position Manager
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 3-4 weeks
Create a smart contract + UI that automates liquidity provision, rebalancing, and exit strategies for pump.fun token launches. This abstracts away manual liquidity management scripts and provides institutional-grade tooling for the maturing token launch ecosystem.
**Why now:** Multiple bundler/bot teams are building around pump.fun, but liquidity management remains manual and fragmented. Despite -44% volume decline, the infrastructure consolidation phase creates demand for standardized tooling. First-mover advantage in institutional-grade automation.
**Tech stack:** Anchor/Rust, pump.fun SDK, Next.js frontend, Solana Web3.js, Marinade/Raydium for liquidity routing
**Reference projects:** ElliteAnts/Pumpswap-Liquidity-Management-Script, cicere/pumpfun-bundler, PumpSwap
### 3. SNS Identity Layer for DeFi Protocols
**Difficulty:** beginner | **Timeframe:** 2-3 days
Build a middleware library that integrates SNS domains as primary identity for DeFi protocols (lending, swaps, margin trading), enabling users to use readable names instead of wallet addresses. This leverages SNS's active SDK development to create a UX layer that bridges naming infrastructure to application adoption.
**Why now:** SNS SDK shows 5 commits with multi-language support—infrastructure is hardening. No DeFi protocol has standardized SNS integration yet. This captures the moment when naming infrastructure becomes a core identity layer, similar to ENS adoption on Ethereum.
**Tech stack:** SNS SDK (TypeScript/Rust), Anchor, Next.js, Solana Web3.js
**Reference projects:** Solana Name Service SDK, Marginfi, Drift Protocol
### 4. MEV Extraction Simulator & Backtest Engine
**Difficulty:** advanced | **Timeframe:** 6-8 weeks
Build a backtesting framework that simulates MEV extraction strategies (sandwich attacks, liquidation bots, arbitrage) against historical Solana block data. This enables bot developers to validate strategies before deployment and understand risk/reward profiles in a sandbox environment.
**Why now:** MEV bot infrastructure is proliferating but lacks standardized testing tools. Developers are currently deploying live without validation—a simulator reduces risk and accelerates bot ecosystem maturation. Jito's infrastructure hardening creates demand for sophisticated analysis tools.
**Tech stack:** Rust (performance-critical), Solana SDK, Jito MEV API, Python (data analysis), PostgreSQL (historical data)
**Reference projects:** no_JIT, pumpfun-bundler, Uniswap V4 (EVM reference)
### 5. Prediction Market Oracle & Settlement Layer
**Difficulty:** advanced | **Timeframe:** 8-12 weeks
Build a Solana-native oracle + settlement contract that enables decentralized prediction markets with on-chain price feeds and automated dispute resolution. This provides the missing infrastructure layer that Polymarket-style protocols need to operate trustlessly on Solana.
**Why now:** L9T-Development is actively building prediction market contracts, signaling category conviction. Solana lacks a standardized oracle + settlement layer for prediction markets—Pyth and Switchboard provide building blocks but no integrated solution exists. This captures early-stage market formation.
**Tech stack:** Anchor/Rust, Pyth Network (price feeds), Switchboard (oracle infrastructure), Next.js frontend, Solana Program Library
**Reference projects:** L9T-Development/prediction-market-smart-contract-solana-evm, Polymarket, Drift Protocol (risk management reference)
### 6. Formal Verification Template Library for Solana
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 3-4 weeks
Create a library of pre-built Certora formal verification specs and templates for common Solana smart contract patterns (token transfers, liquidity pools, lending logic). This lowers the barrier to formal verification adoption and accelerates security standardization across the ecosystem.
**Why now:** Certora is gaining adoption (2 stars) but formal verification remains inaccessible to most developers. Solana's mainstream protocols (Marginfi, Solend) are stable but lack standardized verification—templates democratize security auditing and accelerate production-grade DeFi maturation.
**Tech stack:** Certora Verification Language (CVL), Rust/Anchor, GitHub (template distribution), Documentation (mdBook)
**Reference projects:** Certora/CertoraProver, Orca Whirlpools (verified), Anchor program examples
### 7. Cross-Chain Wallet Bridge for Solana SNS Domains
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 3-4 weeks
Build a bridge that syncs Solana SNS domains across major wallets (Unstoppable, Oisy, OneKey, Cake) via the Wallet Standard, enabling users to manage Solana identity across multiple wallet implementations. This leverages wallet standardization to create a unified identity layer.
**Why now:** Wallet standardization is complete (declining development velocity across major wallets), creating a stable platform for identity layers. SNS infrastructure is expanding simultaneously. This captures the convergence of wallet standardization + naming infrastructure maturation.
**Tech stack:** Wallet Standard (TypeScript), SNS SDK, WalletConnect, Next.js, Solana Web3.js
**Reference projects:** anza-xyz/wallet-standard, Solana Name Service, Unstoppable Wallet, WalletConnect
### 8. Lending Protocol Risk Aggregator & Liquidation Monitor
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 2-3 weeks
Build a real-time risk dashboard that aggregates collateral ratios, liquidation thresholds, and capital utilization across Marginfi, Solend, Kamino, and Hubble. This provides institutional users with unified risk visibility across consolidated lending infrastructure and enables proactive liquidation monitoring.
**Why now:** Core lending protocols show zero development activity and stable volumes—infrastructure is mature and consolidated. $406M stablecoin inflows signal institutional capital seeking entry, but no unified risk monitoring exists. This captures the institutional adoption phase of mature lending infrastructure.
**Tech stack:** Rust (Solana client), Next.js/React, PostgreSQL, Marginfi SDK, Solend SDK, WebSocket for real-time updates
**Reference projects:** Marginfi, Solend, Kamino, Hubble, Solana Beach
### 9. Anchor Program Testing & Deployment Automation Framework
**Difficulty:** beginner | **Timeframe:** 2-3 days
Build a CLI tool + library that automates Anchor program testing, deployment, and verification workflows with built-in Certora integration. This standardizes development practices and reduces boilerplate for the mature Anchor ecosystem, enabling developers to focus on application logic.
**Why now:** Anchor has achieved stable adoption (sustained interest without explosive growth). Developers are now optimizing workflows rather than learning the framework. This captures the maturation phase where standardized tooling accelerates application-layer innovation.
**Tech stack:** Rust, Anchor SDK, Certora CLI, Solana CLI, Clap (CLI framework)
**Reference projects:** Anchor, solana-developers/program-examples, Certora
### 10. HumidiFi Liquidity Pool Optimizer & Yield Aggregator
**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Timeframe:** 2-4 weeks
Build a smart routing + yield aggregation layer that automatically directs swaps to HumidiFi pools when optimal and aggregates yield opportunities across HumidiFi's capital-efficient design. This capitalizes on HumidiFi's emerging volume dominance while providing users with transparent optimization.
**Why now:** HumidiFi has emerged as top DEX by volume ($464M, +12.7%, z-score 3.38) but lacks visible developer activity—sustainability is unconfirmed. Building optimization tooling early captures first-mover advantage and validates the protocol's staying power through infrastructure development.
**Tech stack:** Rust (Solana client), Next.js/React, HumidiFi SDK/API, Jupiter Aggregator (reference), Solana Web3.js
**Reference projects:** HumidiFi, Jupiter Aggregator, Orca DEX, Raydium
